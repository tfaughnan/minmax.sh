# minmax.sh

A simple window minimization/maximization utility for X.
If you've got xdotool, dmenu, and a standalone window manager,
then this _might_ work for you.
Some say minimizing windows is antithetical to such WMs.
Maybe so, but I find it useful sometimes.

`./minmax.sh min` to select and minimize a window.

`./minmax.sh max` to select and maximize a window.

You probably want to bind these to hotkeys. Or maybe you don't.
